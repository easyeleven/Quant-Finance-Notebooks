This course addresses the fundamentals of machine learning. It continues the topics from the Financial Econometrics course whereby students will be able to apply algorithms to learn from data. Students will cover the mathematical and computational foundations of both the supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems, and they will use Python modules and a Tensorflow framework to predict, explain, or compare outcomes across different financial series. Students will apply machine learning techniques to determine if financial models are overfit, and use methods of regularization, cross-validation, and resampling techniques to mitigate it. In addition, students will develop a theoretical and practical background in deep learning models to improve the power of their financial model predictions.
