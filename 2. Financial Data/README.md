This course introduces students to financial data: the source of energy for financial models. Students will learn how to apply Python to properly select, import, filter, structure, visualize, summarize, and analyze financial data for interest rates, equities, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, securitized products, and other asset classes. Students will also learn how to prepare data to be used in models for financial markets, from which decisions can be made, and how to accomplish fundamental analysis with accounting data, technical analysis with trading data, statistical analysis with transformed data, and sentiment analysis with textual data. Software engineering, visualization techniques, probability and statistics, linear algebra, and presentation skills will be developed throughout the course. The ultimate goal of this course is to build foundational skills that enable students to understand the type of data needed depending on their goals, how to source it, structure it, shape it, build with it, and discover what it tells. At their best, financial engineers turn data into empirically based, well-calibrated financial models whose output provides investors and risk managers with sound decisions in the uncertain world of finance.
