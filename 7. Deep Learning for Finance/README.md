Directly building on their skills from Machine Learning, students will further explore neural networks in Deep Learning for Finance. Students will build mastery in Python with TensorFlow to build and train neural networks and apply them to real life financial examples. They will expand their toolkits to perform regularization. During this course, students will use various algorithms to tune hyperparameters, including classical, Bayesian, and stochastic methods. Different neural network architectures will be addressed, particularly CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRUs (Gated Recurring Units). These neural networks will be built from scratch, then illustrated in financial examples such as predicting stock prices, discovering investment factors, and back-testing trading strategies. Students will apply state-of-the-art techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation. These methods will be used to improve the learning capability and performance of the networks, resulting in better predictions. In addition, students will learn the theory behind these tools, as well as richly exploring how to combine architectures with optimization techniques applied to real world data for comprehensive intraday trading strategy development.
