This course provides students with methodologies and skills to perform portfolio optimization. From the previous coursework, students will have a solid foundation on which to engage in the portfolio management process. In the first two modules, students will review classical methods of portfolio theory, including Markowitz portfolio optimization. Subsequent modules address more modern versions of the portfolio optimization process, including Black-Litterman, probabilistic scenario optimization, prospect theory, Kelly criterion, and risk parity. In addition, advanced econometrics and machine learning methods will be applied to the classical techniques, including the use of neural networks, genetic algorithms, information theory, and reinforcement learning. The course requires students to engage with the mathematical foundations, code implementation, and practical applications of portfolio management across many asset classes.
