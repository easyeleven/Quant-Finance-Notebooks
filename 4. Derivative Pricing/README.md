Derivative Pricing is a hands-on course focused on pricing options. Students will build a conceptual background that deepens their understanding of why classical calculus is not sufficient for detecting rates of change in stochastic processes. Course content focuses on the concept of no-arbitrage and perfect replication using the world of stochastic calculus, including the Black-Scholes Model. Students will be able to construct pricing models such as binomial trees and finite difference methods to price an array of vanilla and exotic options. They will also measure sensitivities of the price to variables, such as the underlying price, volatility, time, interest rates, and carry costs. Finally, some extensions to classical models, such as the Heston Model and jump models will be addressed. Much of the course will include Python illustrations to build practical skills.
