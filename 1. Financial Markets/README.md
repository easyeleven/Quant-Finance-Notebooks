In this pilot course for the MScFE program, students are introduced to the world of professional finance: markets, products, participants, and regulation. The activities within financial markets will be discussed, including trading, financing, brokering, pricing, hedging, optimizing, and managing risk. Throughout the course, students identify a list of significant factors that affect the financial industry. Students will be able to interact with web apps that illustrate these concepts. Understanding the asset classes, activities, and influential aspects of the financial landscape will provide a solid foundation on which students will build mathematical and computational tools to develop models for financial engineering. No background in finance is required.
