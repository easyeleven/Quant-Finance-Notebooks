This course provides students with both classical and modern methods of modeling and managing risk. The course begins by reviewing metrics and models for market, credit, and systemic risk, and applying these ideas to multiple asset classes, including derivatives. Machine learning methods will be integrated with both classical methods like VaR and GARCH and with robust methods like Extreme Value Theory. Then a comprehensive review of Bayesian methods will be given that builds towards a Bayesian network of modeling systemic risk. By taking the course, students will be able to synthesize a complex network and scenario analysis for both portfolio risk and systemic risk.
