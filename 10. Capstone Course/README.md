The Capstone Course is designed to put the studentsâ€™ knowledge of financial engineering to the test. Students practically apply their understanding of the program content by accomplishing project milestones from developing a problem statement, identifying the required technology to find a solution to the problem, submitting multiple drafts for peer review and instructor feedback, and finalizing and presenting their fully developed project. The goal of the Capstone Course is to ensure that students have met the program outcomes and are able to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world scenarios.
