This course provides a comprehensive introduction to financial econometrics. Students will learn how to model probability distributions of returns, including graphical, Bayesian, and non-parametrical methods. They will also learn how to model univariate time series, focusing on their moving average, autocorrelations, and volatilities, including GARCH models. Students will build additional tools to see how two financial series can relate to each other, using correlation, vector autoregressions, and cointegration. Further, they will build the statistical foundation and Python coding skills to run econometric models to apply in financial decision making. Finally, they will see how the ideas of bias, variance, and overfitting apply to machine learning.
