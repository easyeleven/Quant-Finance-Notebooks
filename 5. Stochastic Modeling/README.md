In this course, students increase their knowledge of modeling stochastic processes. Students will investigate advanced volatility models that upgrade Black Scholes parameters to variables, increasing their stochastic modeling skills to address heteroskedasticity and variable costs as well as jump diffusions. Students will dive into Markov processes, including hidden Markov process and Markov decision process to financial applications, and will build a mathematical foundation for deep learnings, a tool they will use for machine learnings. Overall, students will be able to evaluate the assumptions, benefits, and difficulties associated with stochastic models.
